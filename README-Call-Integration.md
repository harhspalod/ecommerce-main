# Complete Call System Integration Guide

## üéØ Overview
This system provides complete call triggering with comprehensive JSON data packages for external call systems like Omnidimension. Every call trigger includes customer details, product information, campaign data, call scripts, and purchase history.

## üìä Complete Call Data Package

When a call is triggered, the system generates a comprehensive JSON payload with all necessary information:

```json

  "customer_name": "Alice Johnson",
  "phone_number": "+1-555-123-4567",
  "product_name": "iPhone 15 Pro",
  "product_id": "uuid-product-id",
  "discount": "15%",
  "coupon_code": "PRICE_DROP-15-123456",
  "reason": "Price drop alert for iPhone 15 Pro - Customer eligible for refund",
  "campaign_name": "iPhone 15 Pro Holiday Sale",
  "campaign_id": "uuid-campaign-id",
  "original_price": 999.99,
  "new_price": 849.99,
  "savings_amount": 150.00,

      "amount_paid": 259.98
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîß Integration Methods

### Method 1: FastAPI Webhook Receiver
The included FastAPI server (`fastapi omniprsent/main.py`) receives complete call data:

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
cd "fastapi omniprsent"
python main.py
```

The server will log all incoming call data and provide JSON for external system integration.

### Method 2: Direct API Integration
Integrate directly with the Next.js API endpoints:

```javascript
// Trigger individual call
const response = await fetch('/api/campaigns/trigger-call', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    campaignId: 'campaign-uuid',
    customerId: 'customer-uuid',
    productId: 'product-uuid',
    triggerType: 'price_drop',
    discountPercent: 15,
    newPrice: 849.99,
    originalPrice: 999.99
  })
});

const callData = await response.json();
// callData.callData contains the complete JSON package
```

### Method 3: Price Drop Mass Alerts
Trigger calls for all customers who purchased a specific product:

```javascript
// Trigger price drop for all customers
const response = await fetch('/api/campaigns/price-drop', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    productId: 'product-uuid',
    oldPrice: 999.99,
    newPrice: 849.99,
    discountPercent: 15,
    campaignId: 'campaign-uuid'
  })
});
```
